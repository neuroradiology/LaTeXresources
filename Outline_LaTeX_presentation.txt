Math features
text vs math: 
use modes: LaTeX has text (inline, as is), display math (equations separate from main body), and inline math (super/subscripts are squeezed) modes

most commands make sense (hell, maybe I should learn to math it up), will give a few examples
^Veronica does
once in math mode, spaces and line breaks don’t have significance on their own - considered part of equations need to re-enter text mode with dedicated commands

More examples
figures with captions
tables
beamer slides
