Outline: Getting Started with LaTeX

Uses (quick and flashy)
beautiful typesetting
review math, etc modules
environments for report/book chapters, letters, figure labels, slides, posters, etc.
templates for conferences etc.
version control

Examples of finished products

Basic how-to
article with basic info (author, title, sections, dummy text)
command line compile

Other compilation/editing options
sublime plugin (also exist for other editors)
TeXmaker and other GUIs

Limitations
learning curve
not a editor! (?)

-- Break point for those that need to leave --

Code Examples 
arguments are named what you expect but take getting used to (large, Large, huge, etc.)
Even more code! (examples of how much control you have)
Hand out cheat sheet

Customization w/ packages
itâ€™s easy: \usepackage{packagename}
geometry
setspace
fancyhdr
fonts (need to be named)
tabularx
graphicx (?)
caption

Math features
use modes: LaTeX has text, display math, and inline math (super/subscripts are squeezed) modes
what packages are best?
most commands make sense (hell, maybe I should learn to math it up), will give a few examples
for symbols: detexify.kirelabs.org
math guide: ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/doc/amsmath/short-math-guide.pdf

More examples
figures with captions
tables
