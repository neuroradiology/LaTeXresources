Outline: Getting Started with LaTeX

Uses (quick and flashy)
beautiful typesetting
review math, etc modules
envirnments for report/book chapters, letters, figure labels, slides, etc.

Limitations
not a editor!

Code Examples 
arguments are named what you expect but take getting used to (large, Large, huge, etc.)
Even more code! (examples of how much control you have)


Customization w/ packages
itâ€™s easy: \usepackage{packagename}
geometry
setspace
fancyhdr
fonts (need to be named)

Math features
use modes: LaTeX has text, display math, and inline math (super/subscripts are squeezed) modes
what packages are best?
most commands make sense (hell, maybe I should learn to math it up), will give a few examples
for symbols: detexify.kirelabs.org

Figure labels

Slides


History of TeX
